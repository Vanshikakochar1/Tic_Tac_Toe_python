# Tic_Tac_Toe_python
We need to make an empty game board and then need to take inputs from the players and check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins -- declare the result as “Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game.


**What will we use?**

We will build this game using Python 3, so make sure you have it installed
on your laptop/computer and we are good to go.


**What we’ll learn?**

After building this game, we can get a pretty clear idea about dictionaries
in python, how to access dictionaries, how to iterate over dictionaries, for
loop, if-else conditions and functions in python.

**Output Looks like:**
